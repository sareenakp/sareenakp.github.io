      <description>The advent of IoT has led to massive data generation due to the widespread deployment of sensors, networks, and processing devices. Deep Learning has emerged as a popular computing paradigm that is used to process these large scale data and gather useful information. Of late, companies like Amazon and Google have provided cloud-based Deep Learning solutions. These solutions are referred to as Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS). Recent works have demonstrated that these DLaaS systems are quite vulnerable to adversarial attacks.</description>
