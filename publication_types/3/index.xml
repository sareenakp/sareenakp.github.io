      <title>Karna: A Security Aware EDA Flow for Improved Side-Channel Attack Protection</title>

      <description>Side-channel attacks pose a serious threat to the security of embedded devices. Most available countermeasures have significant overheads and very often do not meet an applicationâ€™s requirement of low-power, high-performance, and small-area. In this work, we propose an algorithm called Karna that can be incorporated in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow, in order to significantly improve the side-channel security of a device, without compromising on the other device characteristics of power, performance, and area.</description>

      <title>White Mirror: Leaking Sensitive Information from Interactive Netflix Movies using Encrypted Traffic Analysis</title>

      <description>Privacy leaks from Netflix videos/movies is well researched. Current state-of-the-art works have been able to obtain coarse-grained information such as the genre and the title of videos by passive observation of encrypted traffic. However, leakage of fine-grained information from encrypted traffic has not been studied so far. Such information can be used to build behavioural profiles of viewers. On 28th December 2018, Netflix released the first mainstream interactive movie called &amp;lsquo;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <title>HALTimer: A Fast Vt Replacement Heuristic for. Leakage Power Minimization </title>

      <description>The discrete Vt sizing technique is employed at all stages of the physical synthesis flow, because it does not impact the placement yet provides significant room for power/timing optimization. The timing-constrained discrete Vt sizing problem (TC-DVSP) is NP-complete and earlier techniques reported for the same, employed iterative greedy or sensitivity-driven heuristics, that required incremental timing analysis after every iteration. The key observation reported in this paper is that there exists a good correlation between the slack distribution among gates in a given iteration and the order of gate replacements in subsequent iterations.</description>

      <title>FastReplace: Efficient Vt Replacement Technique for Leakage Power Minimization</title>
      <link>https://patanjali.github.io/publication/poster/paper6/</link>

      <description>We consider the timing-constrained discrete Vt-assignment problem for leakage minimization in digital circuits. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Greedy or Sensitivity-driven heuristics are known to be very effective for iterative Vt-assignment, with incremental timing analysis performed between the iterations. These heuristics, while offering good leakage power savings, carry a huge run-time penalty with increase in circuit size. In iterative Vt-assignment, we observe that there is a good correlation between the slack distribution in a given iteration, and the order of gate replacements in subsequent iterations.</description>
