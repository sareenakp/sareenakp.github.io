        <div style = "text-align: justify"> <h6>The timing constrained discrete sizing technique (TC-DSP) is employed at all stages of the physical synthesis flow and has been studied extensively over the last 30 years. The ISPD gate
sizing contests introduced industry standard benchmarks and library which motivated a lot of research in this area. However most of the solutions employed were either sensitivity driven or based on analytical methods that required incremental timing analysis after every iteration with both consuming a significant amount of time to perform the optimization. The key observations reported in this paper are i) there exists a good correlation between the slack distribution among gates in a given iteration and the order of gate replacements in subsequent iterations; and, ii) across the benchmark circuits there exists significant overlap in the number of sub-circuits that have similar structures. This paper exploits the above observations to propose MLTimer, an iterative algorithm that uses adaptive lazy timing analysis in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) engine for solving the TC-DSP quickly and efficiently. We observe that for large benchmark circuits (≥ 200,000) our proposed solution reduces the leakage power by 3% and the running time by over 50% when compared to the best reported heuristic in the literature. This significant decrease in running time is very useful to the industry for achieving timing and power closures of large designs within a given deadline.</h6></div></td></tr>

        <div style = "text-align: justify"> <h6>Abstract—The discrete Vt sizing technique is employed at all stages of the physical synthesis flow, because it does not impact the placement yet provides significant room for power/timing optimization. The timing-constrained discrete Vt sizing problem (TC-DVSP) is NP-complete and earlier techniques reported for the same, employed iterative greedy or sensitivity-driven heuristics, that required incremental timing analysis after every   iteration. The key observation reported in this paper is that there exists a good correlation between the slack distribution among gates in a given iteration and the order of gate replacements in subsequent iterations. This paper exploits the above observation to propose HALTimer, an iterative algorithm that uses adaptive lazy timing analysis to solve the TC-DVSP. For large ISPD and ITC circuits, HALTimer reduces the running time from several days to a few hours. This significant decrease in running time is very useful to the industry for achieving timing and power closures of large designs within a given
deadline. </h6></div></td></tr>

        <div style = "text-align: justify"> <h6>We consider the timing-constrained discrete Vt-assignment problem for leakage minimization in digital circuits. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Greedy or Sensitivity-driven heuristics are known to be very effective for iterative Vt-assignment, with incremental timing analysis performed between the iterations. These heuristics, while offering good leakage power savings, carry a huge run-time penalty with increase in circuit size.

In iterative Vt-assignment, we observe that there is a good correlation between the slack distribution in a given iteration, and the order of gate replacements in subsequent iterations. This paper proposes an algorithm, which exploits this high correlation to speed up the Vt-assignment process. The proposed algorithm uses gate replacement windows, with lazy timing evaluation, to reduce the total number of incremental STA runs during the optimization. At the end of each iteration, the successive window size is dynamically scaled up/down based on the timing updates at the end of the current window. The proposed algorithm, when applied to ISCAS/ITC circuits, significantly reduced the run-time without impacting the solution quality.

Ideally, a synchronization technique should be able to fully exploit the available cores, leading to improved performance. However, with the growing demand for energy-efficient systems, it also needs to work within the energy and power budget of the system. In this paper, we perform a detailed study of the performance as well as energy efficiency of popular shared-data synchronization techniques on a commodity multi-core processor. We show that Software Transactional Memory (STM) systems can perform better than locks for workloads where a significant portion of the running time is spent in the critical sections. We also show how power-conserving techniques available on modern processors like C-states and clock frequency scaling impact energy consumption and performance. Finally, we compare the performance of STMs and locks under similar power budgets. </h6></div></td></tr>

<h2>Problem Statement </h2>
 <div style = "text-align: justify">
   In a typical design flow, multiple tools and scripts are used. Each tool reads the input,
 its associated constraints, processes and generates data as output. At present there is no
 mechanism to represent this data in a database which limits the possibility of live query on
 the data and get a useful information and value add out of it. For example: to find a timing
 critical path it requires to load a timer which in turn processes the input and eventually
 writes out report. Instead, it can be easily queried if the database is annotated with relevant
 information. The project addresses the following:</div>
 
   <ul>
   <li> Using Graph based data base representation like Neo4J/MongoDB </li>
   <li> Handle Hierarchical design data </li>
   <li> Distribution over multiple clusters (as design is developed over multiple sites and multiple people and partitioned)  </li>
   <li> Extensible as data can be annotated with any information on top of the base structure.</li>
   <li> Common and useful queries as value added service.</li>
   </ul>
