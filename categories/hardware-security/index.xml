      <description>Fault attacks are one of the growing physical attacks exploits that target edge devices. The attacker introduces faults at specific locations in the device during encryption thereby corrupting the result of the operation. These faults are introduced by either manipulating the system clock, the power supply or by using a laser. Traditional countermeasures rely on redundant logic, parity checking which introduce area and power overheads. In this work, we explore the idea of gate-sizing as a countermeasure for fault attacks.</description>
